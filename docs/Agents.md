# Agents

The Agent screen functions offers you a view of your agents' performance. The information from this screen is available in both a list view, and a board view, illustrated in the images that follow. You can toggle between both views using the `View` icon in the top right of the screen.

Each entry within the agents screen includes: 
- **Name**: Unique identifier or display name of the agent.
- **Team**: Team to which the agent is assigned. 
- **Calls/Interactions**: Total number of calls handled by the agent within a designated timeframe. 
- **Issues**: Percentage of calls identified as containing customer concerns. 
- **Strengths/Take a Bow**: Top areas of agent strength, based on pre-defined metrics like resolution rate, customer satisfaction, and adherence to scripts. 
- **Weaknesses/Improvement Areas**: Areas identified for potential improvement, pinpointed through analysis of metrics like call handling time, missed customer cues, or script deviations. 
- **Rank**: Relative position within the team based on overall performance metrics. 
- **Detailed View**: Clicking on an agent's entry opens a dedicated page for granular analysis. This view will be discussed in the next subsection.


The Vela call screen facilitates efficient navigation and manipulation of your contact center data. 
Users can:

- **Sort**: Order entries by any table column, except the Detailed View column, for streamlined identification of specific agent performance metrics. 
- **Filter**: Apply targeted criteria based on various parameters enabling focused analysis on relevant interactions. 
- **Export**: Download the entire table as a CSV file for further analysis in external data visualisation or statistical software tools.
