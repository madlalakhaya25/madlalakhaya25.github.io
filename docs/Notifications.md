# Notifications


The Notifications Screen offers a centralised view of all platform alerts and updates, facilitating efficient monitoring 
and prompt action on critical issues, comments, and reports. On this screen, notifications are categorised into the
 following three dedicated tabs.


## Issues

This tab displays notifications related to potential problems picked up by the Smart Detector. See the Smart Detector 
section of this documentation for additional information.

Full details of the issue are not directly accessible from the notification card. Clicking the `View` icon on a specific issue notification card directs users to the corresponding detailed screen from which the issue stems. This allows for closer examination and contextual understanding of the issue.  It is important to note that closing or dismissing the issue notification card within the Notifications screen does not  mark the issue as resolved. To address the issue directly, users must navigate to the associated detailed screen and  utilise the designated resolution functions provided there.

## Comments

This tab presents notifications informing users about comments left by other team members on various elements, such as call transcripts.

Full details of the comment, including its complete text and context, are not directly accessible from the notification card. 
 
Clicking the `View` icon on a specific comment notification card directs users to the corresponding detailed screen (that is, the call transcript view) where the comment was originally left. 

This allows for closer examination and contextual understanding of the comment. It is important to note that closing or dismissing the comment notification card within the Notifications screen does not mark the comment as resolved. To address the comment directly, users must navigate to the associated detailed screen and utilise the designated resolution functions provided there.

## Reports

This tab provides notifications regarding newly generated reports becoming available.

Users can interact with report notifications through dedicated icons:

- **View**: Clicking the `VIEW` icon opens the corresponding report in a new window, allowing users to access its full content. 
- **Download**: Clicking the `DOWNLOAD` icon saves the report locally as a PDF for further analysis or sharing with external stakeholders. 
- **Close**: Clicking the `CLOSE` icon removes the notification card from the Reports tab, acknowledging the user's awareness of the report's availability.

It's important to note that closing a notification card does not automatically delete the report itself. Reports remain accessible through dedicated report management functionalities within the platform's Report screen.
