# Smart Search

The Smart Search section harnesses advanced natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning algorithms to dissect individual calls.

The Smart Search screen serves as the central hub for managing automated searches within your call transcript data. It allows users to build complex search queries that identify the presence or absence of specific elements like words, phrases, or topics. Once activated, these pre-defined criteria continuously scan incoming transcripts, automatically flagging matches as "issues" for further investigation and analysis. The Smart Search page is organized into 4 tabs which allow users to create and enable various search queries.

## General Search

This tab allows users to view and create general searches applicable to the entire corpus of call transcripts. It also offers a library of pre-built search templates for common use cases.

### View

The View tab of Vela's **Smart Search > General** screen offers a tabular view of the auto search queries created within your organization.
